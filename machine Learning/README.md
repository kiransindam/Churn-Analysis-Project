# Customer Churn Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn data and build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a service. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and understand the factors contributing to churn, enabling targeted retention strategies. The project follows a complete data science workflow, from data analysis to model deployment.
## Project Steps
1.	Data Understanding
o	Objective: Familiarize with the dataset and understand the business problem.
o	Steps:
	Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
	Review key features such as customer_id, credit_score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member, estimated_salary, and churn.
	Identify the target variable (churn) and other relevant features.
	Check for missing values, data types, and overall dataset quality.
# 2.	Data Preprocessing
o	Objective: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
o	Steps:
	Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
	Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender and country).
	Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed (e.g., credit_score, balance).
	Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
# 3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
o	Objective: Perform an in-depth analysis to gain insights into the data.
o	Steps:
	Visualize the distribution of the target variable (churn).
	Explore relationships between features (e.g., correlation heatmaps, pair plots).
	Investigate churn rates across different segments (e.g., by age group, tenure, balance).
	Use plots like histograms, bar charts, and box plots for better understanding.
# 4.	Feature Engineering
o	Objective: Enhance the dataset by creating new features or modifying existing ones.
o	Steps:
	Create new features based on existing data (e.g., balance-to-salary ratio).
	Drop redundant or highly correlated features that do not add value.
	Ensure features are scaled appropriately if using distance-based algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors).
# 5.	Model Building
o	Objective: Train various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
o	Steps:
	Choose multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
	Train models on the training dataset and evaluate on the testing set.
	Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess each model's effectiveness.
# 6.	Model Evaluation and Tuning
o	Objective: Optimize the best-performing model.
o	Steps:
	Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using Grid Search or Random Search) to find the best parameters.
	Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalization.
	Evaluate model improvements and finalize the chosen model.
# 7.	Model Deployment
o	Objective: Make the predictive model accessible for users to make real-time predictions.
o	Steps:
	Save the trained model using libraries like pickle or joblib.
	Develop a web application using frameworks such as Flask or Streamlit to create a user interface.
	Integrate the model with the web app for real-time predictions.
	Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
	Create documentation to explain how users can interact with the deployed app.
# 8.	Monitoring and Maintenance
o	Objective: Ensure the deployed model remains accurate over time.
o	Steps:
	Set up logging and monitoring to track the model's performance in production.
	Regularly update the model with new data for retraining.
	Make improvements based on user feedback and new business requirements.
