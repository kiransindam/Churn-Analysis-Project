# Customer Churn Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn data and build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a service. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and understand the factors contributing to churn, enabling targeted retention strategies. The project follows a complete data science workflow, from data analysis to model deployment.

## Project Steps
Data Understanding
> Objective: Familiarize with the dataset and understand the business problem.
> Steps:Load the dataset and inspect its structure.
Review key features such as customer_id, credit_score, country, gender, age, tenure, balance, products_number, credit_card, active_member, estimated_salary, and churn.
Identify the target variable (churn) and other relevant features.
Check for missing values, data types, and overall dataset quality.
Data Preprocessing

Objective: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Steps:
Handle missing values (e.g., imputation or removal).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for gender and country).
Normalize or standardize numerical features if needed (e.g., credit_score, balance).
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective: Perform an in-depth analysis to gain insights into the data.
Steps:
Visualize the distribution of the target variable (churn).
Explore relationships between features (e.g., correlation heatmaps, pair plots).
Investigate churn rates across different segments (e.g., by age group, tenure, balance).
Use plots like histograms, bar charts, and box plots for better understanding.
Feature Engineering

Objective: Enhance the dataset by creating new features or modifying existing ones.
Steps:
Create new features based on existing data (e.g., balance-to-salary ratio).
Drop redundant or highly correlated features that do not add value.
Ensure features are scaled appropriately if using distance-based algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors).
Model Building

Objective: Train various machine learning models to predict customer churn.
Steps:
Choose multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Train models on the training dataset and evaluate on the testing set.
Use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess each model's effectiveness.
Model Evaluation and Tuning

Objective: Optimize the best-performing model.
Steps:
Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., using Grid Search or Random Search) to find the best parameters.
Use cross-validation techniques to ensure model generalization.
Evaluate model improvements and finalize the chosen model.
Model Deployment

Objective: Make the predictive model accessible for users to make real-time predictions.
Steps:
Save the trained model using libraries like pickle or joblib.
Develop a web application using frameworks such as Flask or Streamlit to create a user interface.
Integrate the model with the web app for real-time predictions.
Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
Create documentation to explain how users can interact with the deployed app.
Monitoring and Maintenance

Objective: Ensure the deployed model remains accurate over time.
Steps:
Set up logging and monitoring to track the model's performance in production.
Regularly update the model with new data for retraining.
Make improvements based on user feedback and new business requirements.
