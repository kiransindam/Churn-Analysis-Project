# Customer Churn Analysis: SQL Documentation
This documentation provides an overview of how to use SQL for data exploration, analysis, and insights extraction in the Customer Churn Analysis project. It covers setting up the database, writing SQL queries of varying complexity, and interpreting the results to understand factors influencing customer churn.

# 1. Database Setup
The dataset contains information about customers, including demographic details, account attributes, and churn status. We'll begin by creating a table to store the data:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE customer_churn (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    credit_score INT,
    country VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    tenure INT,
    balance DECIMAL(15, 2),
    products_number INT,
    credit_card TINYINT(1),
    active_member TINYINT(1),
    estimated_salary DECIMAL(15, 2),
    churn TINYINT(1)
);
customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer.
credit_score: Credit score of the customer.
country: The country where the customer resides.
gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
age: Age of the customer.
tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank.
balance: Current balance in the customerâ€™s account.
products_number: Number of bank products the customer uses.
credit_card: Indicator of whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
active_member: Indicator of whether the customer is an active bank member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
estimated_salary: Estimated annual salary of the customer.
churn: Indicates if the customer churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

# 2. SQL Query Guide
This guide is divided into three categories: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced queries. Each level provides a different depth of analysis.

# 2.1 Basic SQL Queries
Basic queries are used to retrieve and filter data, perform simple calculations, and understand the distribution of data.

####  Query 1: Retrieve all customers from France.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM customer_churn
WHERE country = 'France';
Purpose: To list customers based on geographical location.

####  Query 2: Find the average credit score of all customers.

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(credit_score) AS average_credit_score
FROM customer_churn;
Purpose: To calculate the average credit score of the bank's customers.

# 2.2 Intermediate SQL Queries
Intermediate queries involve aggregations, grouping, and filtering based on certain criteria.

####  Query 3: Get the total number of customers who have churned, grouped by gender.

sql
Copy code
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS churned_customers
FROM customer_churn
WHERE churn = 1
GROUP BY gender;
Purpose: To analyze the distribution of churn across different genders.

####  Query 4: Calculate the average balance of customers, grouped by the number of products they use.

sql
Copy code
SELECT products_number, AVG(balance) AS average_balance
FROM customer_churn
GROUP BY products_number;
Purpose: To understand how the number of products relates to customer account balance.

# 2.3 Advanced SQL Queries
Advanced queries use more complex techniques, such as subqueries, window functions, and conditional aggregations.

#### Query 5: Identify customers who are more likely to churn based on age and tenure.

sql
Copy code
SELECT age, tenure, 
       SUM(churn) / COUNT(*) AS churn_rate
FROM customer_churn
GROUP BY age, tenure
HAVING churn_rate > 0.5
ORDER BY churn_rate DESC;
Purpose: To find age and tenure combinations associated with higher churn rates.

####  Query 6: Calculate the cumulative churn rate by country using a window function.

sql
Copy code
SELECT country, churn,
       SUM(churn) OVER (PARTITION BY country ORDER BY customer_id) AS cumulative_churn
FROM customer_churn;
Purpose: To track the progression of churn within each country.

# 3. Query Interpretation

Interpreting SQL query results is crucial for gaining insights:
High Churn Rate Groups: Identifying demographics or account attributes associated with high churn rates can guide targeted retention strategies.
Average Metrics Analysis: Understanding averages, such as credit scores or balances, provides context for customer segmentation.
Grouping and Aggregation: Helps uncover patterns across different groups (e.g., by age, gender, or number of products).

# 4. Best Practices

Use Indexes: Improve query performance by indexing commonly used columns, such as customer_id and churn.
Write Efficient Queries: Avoid unnecessary subqueries or joins when simple filters can be applied.
Data Validation: Regularly validate the dataset to ensure data integrity before running complex queries.

# 5. Conclusion

Using SQL in this project provides a robust approach to understanding customer churn. It facilitates data exploration, enables advanced analytics, and supports decision-making processes for customer retention. This documentation serves as a guide for beginners and intermediate users to practice SQL skills while solving real-world business problems.
