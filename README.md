# Project Overview
The Customer Churn Analysis project involves the following steps:

# Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Importing the dataset and performing data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.).
Ensuring correct data types for each column and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducting an initial analysis to understand the data distribution and relationships.
Visualizing various factors that might influence churn, such as age, credit score, and account balance.
Data Visualization with Power BI:

Creating a Power BI dashboard to present key metrics and insights.
Utilizing various charts (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, etc.) to display churn trends, customer segmentation, and financial impact.
Adding interactive features like slicers and filters to allow users to explore the data.
Key Sections of the Dashboard:

Churn Overview: Displays the overall churn rate, total customers, and key financial metrics.
Segmentation Analysis: Shows churn patterns across different demographic and behavioral segments.
Churn Drivers: Highlights factors correlated with churn, such as credit score, product ownership, and active membership status.
Time Series Analysis: Illustrates churn trends over time if date-related data is available.
Insights and Recommendations:

Analyzing the main drivers of churn based on data patterns.
Providing recommendations for targeted customer retention strategies.
Predictive Modeling (Optional):

Implementing machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict customer churn.
Visualizing the model's output in Power BI for actionable insights.
